# Women Who Code DC Mini Projects
This repository hosts a set of code projects and solutions that are good practice for Python programmers. 

Each folder in the repository contains a description for itself.
### Projects:
##### In a vaguely suggested order
2.  [Factorial Calculator](https://github.com/emmagras/wwc-mini-projects/tree/master/factorial)
1.  [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/emmagras/wwc-mini-projects/tree/master/fibonacci)
2.  [Roman Numeral Converter](https://github.com/emmagras/wwc-mini-projects/tree/master/roman-numerals)

### Adding Projects!
The requirements for suggested projects or adding a suggested project to the repository are quite low. Below we have a list of projects that haven't been given their own folder complete with simple _README_ and and _example solution_:
-  [Goldbach's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture)
-  [Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/emmagras/wwc-mini-projects/tree/master/fizz-buzz)

Please feel encouraged to contribute!


## GitHub / Intro to Open Source Software
### What is GitHub?
This very site, _GitHub_ is one of the tech industry staples. GitHub can be quite overwhelming, but we're only going to use a few of its features, so nothing will be too complicated.
You're currently looking at the Read-Me for my GitHub _repository_. I (hi, I'm Emma Grasmeder), created this file (all the files in the _repository_) on my personal computer at home. It's all saved to a _local repository_ on my hard drive. (the folders on my computer look like: `home/emma/code-n-stuff/wwc/tutorials/roman-numerals/README.md`) Once the _local repository_ looked like anything worth sharing, I _pushed_ my _local repository_ to a _remote repository_, which is what GitHub hosts. At that point, this project became _open source software_.

### Getting Started with one of the Projects
I've created a _master branch_, which stores the current front-facing state of the project, created by everyone who has contributed to the project. If you catch a typo, you can edit the file and _push_ it to us, and that change will eventually reflected in the _master branch_. But this _branch_ is designed to be a template for your own work. 
- *The simplest way to get started is to use this _remote repository_ as an online tutorial. Find a project you're interested in, read the README, and write the code on your computer, without using Git at all.*
- *The slightly harder way will help you get ready for a professional environment and involves using `git`.*
  1. Install git on your computer
  1. Clone this _remote repository_ to your computer (thereby making it your _local repository_) by typing `git clone https://github.com/emmagras/wwc-mini-projects.git`. 
  Now you have everything from the _remote repository_ on GitHub on your own computer. This `README.md` is on your computer, as are all the project folders. Make a _new, local, branch_, write your solution, and push the solution to this repository on your own branch for others to see.
