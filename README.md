# Women Who Code DC Mini Projects
This repository hosts a set of code projects and solutions that are good practice for Python programmers. 

Each folder in the repository contains a description for itself.
### Projects:

## GitHub / Intro to Open Source Software
### What is GitHub?
This very site, _GitHub_ is one of the tech industry staples. GitHub can be quite overwhelming, but we're only going to use a few of its features, so nothing will be too complicated.
You're currently looking at the Read-Me for my GitHub _repository_. I (hi, I'm Emma Grasmeder), created this file (all the files in the _repository_) on my personal computer at home. It's all saved to a _local repository_ on my hard drive. (the folders on my computer look like: `home/emma/code-n-stuff/wwc/tutorials/roman-numerals/README.md`) Once the _local repository_ looked like anything worth sharing, I _pushed_ my _local repository_ to a _remote repository_, which is what GitHub hosts. At that point, this project became _open source software_.
### Getting Started with the Roman Numerals Project
I've created a _master branch_, which stores the current front-facing state of the project. If you catch a typo, you can edit this (or any) file and _push_ it to me, and that change will eventually reflected in the _master branch_. But this _branch_ is designed to be a template for your own work. 
- *The simplest way to get started is to use this _remote repository_ as an online tutorial. Create a rom_num_converter.py file someplace on your computer, read the [Roman Numerals Overview]() and begin working on your own.*
- *The harder, (more professional? Emma is an opinionated elitist, so take her with a grain of salt) way to get started is to use `git`.*
  1. Install git on your computer
  1. Clone this _remote repository_ to your computer (thereby making it your _local repository_) by typing `git clone https://github.com/emmagras/roman-numerals.git`. 
  Now you have everything from the _remote repository_ on GitHub on your own computer. This `README.md` is on your computer, the `roman-numerals/resources/RomanNumeralsOverview.txt` with all the info you need about Roman Numerals is also on your computer. You also have a few `.py` files already created, which you can now edit and use to your liking.
