If you were looking at your project on your own computer, you'd see your project folder on the same level as other folders you have. 
I've provided you some other folders, which you should just ignore. 

The `sampleproject` folder above is taken directly from [the Python documentation](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) regarding project structure.
To actually make/start making this package, bring up `Terminal`/`cmd` and start like this:
From wherever you want to keep your python project:

1. `$ mkdir sampleproject`
  1. That will result in the `sampleproject/` folder
1. `$ cd sampleproject`
  1. This will move you into your new 
1. `$ git init`
  1. start tracking your project's development with git
1. `$ mkdir sampleproject/tests`
1. `$ mkdir sampleprojects/data`
1. `$ mkdir sampleprojects/sample`
  1. this `sample/` folder is where all your important Python files will live. 
  1. make as many subfolders from in there as you'd like
